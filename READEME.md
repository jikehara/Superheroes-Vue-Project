BSCA Superheroes Vue project
Joseph Ikehara
Summer 2017

This is my first full-stack Vue/Express/Mongoose application.


To run the database, must always run:

    sudo mongod

    (In Windows, do a command window and type in

      "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongod.exe"

      exactly as that, it's the windows equivalent)

Then leave that terminal open

To run browser-sync:

  <!-- browser-sync start --server --files "*.html, css/*.css, js/*.js" -->



This project will use the following packages:
-ExpressJS
-Body Parser
-Mongoose
